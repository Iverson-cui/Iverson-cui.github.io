# Introduction

Research interest
======

My research interest main includes applied cryptography, verifiable machine learning, zero knowledge proofs;computer architecture(RISC-V);computer network etc. I'm always ready to embark on a new journey of new research field about computer science!

# Hobbies and daily life

My hobby expands generally to many fields.
- sports(basketball, running, swimming, gym etc.)
- reading books(I keep my note of reading in the blog)
- watching TV series(Friend, Modern Family, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Attack on Titan, Unnatural death etc.)
- enjoying music(classical music, popular music)
- playing games

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
