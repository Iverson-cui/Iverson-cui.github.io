Education
======

* B.S. in China, Tianjin University, 2026 (expected)

research experience
======
* Research assistant at TANKLAB (Jul. 2024 - now)
  * Advisor: [Prof. Wenxin Li](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/liwenxin/index.html)
  * Keyword: FPGA, Edge network
  * My job: I was deeply involved in the entire process of publishing a paper. I was responsible for an experiment involving the interaction between a Bluetooth module using FPGA and a PC. I also participated in drawing diagrams, polishing the article, and typesetting. 

* National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training for University of PRC (Apr. 2024 - May 2025)
  * Advisor: [Prof. Qiang Liu](https://faculty.tju.edu.cn/QiangLiu/en/index.htm)
  * Key word: CNN, Zero knowledge proof
  * My job: I led a project on zero-knowledge proofs and convolutional neural networks. I started from scratch to learn mathematical concepts such as group theory, elliptic curves, and bilinear pairing, as well as cryptographic primitives and protocols like zkSNARK and sum-check. Subsequently, I attempted to combine data parallelism with the GKR protocol to verify the correct operation of neural networks, resulting in a paper (currently in progress) and a patent.

project experience
======
* One Student One Chip open source project(Jan. 2025 - now)
  * Keyword: FPGA, RISC-V
  * About this project: [One Student One Chip](https://ysyx.oscc.cc/) is a veri famous open source project led by University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Once completed, this project can provide students with the opportunity of making their own RISC-V CPU.
  * My job: I haven't gotten into the deepest parts of this project yet, but I've still gained a lot. Recently in this project, my effort is mainly devoted to this [project](https://nju-projectn.github.io/ics-pa-gitbook/) in One Student One Chip. In this project, with the provided architecture, I have completed a NEMU that acts as an emulator of RISC-V CPU hardware, processing RISC-V instructions. What's more, I have added many other functions such as watchpoint, instruction trace, memory trace, function trace etc. 
  * What I learned: Basic tools of Linux programming, such as Make, GDB. My programming skills are also improved during the process. I have written notes and blog posts up to tens of thousands of words based on this project. 
  
Skills
======
* Programming: C/C++, verilog, python
* Language: English, Chinese(native), Japanese
* Tools: FPGA programming, Linux programming workflow etc.
